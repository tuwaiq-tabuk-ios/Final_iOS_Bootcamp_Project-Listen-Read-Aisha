# Final_iOS_Bootcamp_Project-Listen-Read-Aisha
Listen&amp;Read is a new concept of reading books. While users are reading a book, words are highlighted with a synchronised voice in off


## Motivation
When reading foreign language novels in a conventional book or a reader, we pronounce for our selves in our own accent. It would be nice that readers could pronounce the words and sentences of the novel with the local phonetics of the language we are reading.


## Project description
Listen&Read is an app that a voice in off is reading novels and users follow the reading seeing how the words highlight as the voice is reading.

It is very helpful for people reading foreign languages as they get the correct pronunciation while they are reading. In case of dificulties in following the voice, this can talk at a a lower rate.

Users can also give verbal commands to the app for instance to look for a word, start reading from a given chapter, stop the audio or decrease the speed of reading."
Target User
Anyone interested in reading novels with a voice in off.
